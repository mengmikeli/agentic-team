---

## Per-Criterion Results

### 1. Correctness — does the code do what the spec says?

**PASS**

Spec (PRODUCT.md #26): `agt report <feature>` prints to stdout; `--md` writes REPORT.md. Required: what shipped, what passed/failed, time spent, token usage, recommendations.

All five sections verified in `buildReport`:
- Header with feature name, status label, duration, task count, timestamps (lines 15–38)
- What Shipped — lists passed task titles (lines 40–48)
- Task Summary — markdown table with id, title, status, attempts, gate verdict (lines 50–59)
- Cost Breakdown — total USD or N/A, dispatches, gate pass/fail counts, per-phase split (lines 61–77)
- Blocked/Failed Tasks — conditional, with `lastReason` (lines 79–88)
- Recommendations — conditional, high-attempt tasks, gate warnings, stalled detection (lines 90–114)

`cmdReport` dispatches correctly: stdout by default (line 170), `--md` writes REPORT.md (lines 165–168). Errors route to stderr (lines 143, 151, 158). All error exits use code 1.

Status label ternary at lines 30–33 correctly maps `completed`, `failed`, `blocked`, and fallback `"run in progress"`.

`--md` flag uses `args.includes("--md")` (line 129) — clean boolean parse, no silent fallthrough.

### 2. Code quality — readable, well-named, easy to reason about?

**PASS**

`buildReport` is a pure function: takes `state`, returns a string. No I/O, no side effects, fully unit-testable. Each section is clearly labeled with comments. Variable names are descriptive (`passGates`, `failGates`, `highAttempts`, `gateWarnings`, `problem`).

`cmdReport` uses dependency injection for all 7 external dependencies (`readState`, `existsSync`, `writeFileSync`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `exit`, `cwd`). This is the project's standard testability pattern.

No dead code: the `isComplete` variable that was flagged by previous Simplicity reviews has been removed. All declared variables are referenced.

### 3. Error handling — failure paths handled explicitly and safely?

**PASS**

Three error paths in `cmdReport`, all tested:
- Missing feature name → usage to stderr + exit 1 (lines 142–146)
- Feature directory absent → error to stderr + exit 1 (lines 150–154)
- STATE.json missing or corrupt → error to stderr + exit 1 (lines 157–161). Error message says "missing or unreadable", correctly covering both absent-file and JSON-parse-failure cases.

`readState` in `util.mjs:190–197` catches JSON parse errors and returns `null`. `cmdReport` checks for null and exits cleanly.

Errors write to `_stderr` (not `_stdout`), consistent with Unix pipe idiom. This was fixed from earlier runs.

`buildReport` never throws: optional chaining guards all nullable paths (`state.tokenUsage?.total?.costUsd`, `task.attempts ?? 0`, `task.status || "unknown"`).

### 4. Performance — obvious inefficiencies?

**PASS**

Single synchronous parse of in-memory STATE.json. Gate filtering is O(n×m) over small per-feature collections (tasks × gates). No n+1, no repeated I/O, no unnecessary allocations. `writeFileSync` is synchronous — no TOCTOU window.

### 5. Edge cases verified

| Edge case | Result |
|---|---|
| `--md` before positional arg | ✓ `args.find(a => !a.startsWith("-"))` skips `--md` correctly |
| No feature name | ✓ usage + exit 1 (tested) |
| Feature dir missing | ✓ error + exit 1 (tested) |
| STATE.json missing or corrupt | ✓ `readState` returns null, caught (tested) |
| Task with no gates | ✓ `"—"` shown in table (tested) |
| Task with missing title | ✓ `"—"` fallback (tested) |
| Failed feature header label | ✓ explicit ternary, tested |
| Blocked feature header label | ✓ explicit ternary, tested |
| All tasks blocked → stalled rec | ✓ tested |
| Tasks with ≥3 attempts → recommendation | ✓ tested, boundary at 2 confirmed negative |
| Gate warning history | ✓ tested with `flatMap` + `Set` deduplication |
| `tokenUsage.byPhase` with real costs | ✓ tested: `$0.0060` and `$0.0040` verified |
| Invalid ISO `createdAt` | ⚠ `NaN` arithmetic → `"NaNm"` duration; no guard |

---

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:148 — `featureName` from CLI args passed unsanitized to `path.join()`; with `--md`, writes REPORT.md to an attacker-controlled path (e.g., `agt report ../../../../tmp --md`). Validate `featureName` matches `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/` before constructing `featureDir`. Low risk for direct CLI use; real risk if orchestrated with external input.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:17 — Invalid ISO string in `createdAt` produces `"NaNm"` duration via `NaN` arithmetic; add `Number.isFinite(mins)` guard and fall back to `"N/A"`.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:107 — `"No gate passes recorded"` recommendation fires for in-progress features on first gate failure, producing a false positive; guard on terminal status before emitting.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:98 — Empty `gateWarningHistory[].layers` array yields `"Task X has repeated gate warnings: "` with blank suffix; guard on `unique.length > 0` before pushing.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The implementation correctly satisfies all spec requirements. `buildReport` is a clean pure function with no I/O. `cmdReport` uses idiomatic dependency injection with proper error routing to stderr. All 28 tests pass independently. The `--md` boolean flag is minimal and correct. One 🟡 warning (path traversal via unsanitized feature name) should enter the backlog. Three 🔵 suggestions are optional quality improvements for edge-case robustness. No critical issues block merge.

## Builder Claim vs Evidence

**Task-1 handshake claim:** "Verified `agt report <feature>` prints all 6 required sections (Header, What Shipped, Task Summary, Cost Breakdown, Blocked/Failed, Recommendations) to stdout. Implementation in bin/lib/report.mjs with CLI wiring in bin/agt.mjs."

**Task-7 handshake claim:** "Fixed dead code in Blocked/Failed section: removed unreachable `|| \"unknown\"` fallback since tasks are pre-filtered to blocked/failed status. Added regression tests."

**Verification:**

1. All 3 claimed artifact files exist: `bin/lib/report.mjs` (173 lines), `bin/agt.mjs` (import + dispatch + help), `test/report.test.mjs` (377 lines). ✓
2. All 6 sections present in `buildReport`: Header (lines 15–38), What Shipped (40–48), Task Summary (50–59), Cost Breakdown (61–77), Blocked/Failed (79–88), Recommendations (90–114). ✓
3. CLI wiring in `bin/agt.mjs`: import at line 19, dispatch at line 75, help block at lines 188–195, summary at line 248. ✓
4. Dead code fix from task-7: `task.status.toUpperCase()` at line 84 — no `|| "unknown"` fallback, correct because filter at line 80 guarantees status is `"blocked"` or `"failed"`. ✓
5. All 29 tests pass independently. ✓

## Architectural Assessment

### 1. Module Boundaries — PASS

`report.mjs` is a single-purpose module with two exports: `buildReport` (pure function) and `cmdReport` (CLI handler). It imports exactly 3 dependencies: `fs.existsSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`, `path.join` from Node stdlib, and `readState` from `util.mjs`. No circular dependencies. No coupling to the harness, run loop, or state machine.

The module is consumed from exactly one location: `bin/agt.mjs:19` → dispatched at line 75. This is the project's standard pattern for CLI commands — each command lives in its own `bin/lib/<name>.mjs` file, imported and dispatched from the central `agt.mjs` switch. `report.mjs` follows this convention exactly.

### 2. Data Coupling — PASS

`buildReport` reads from the STATE.json schema via the `state` parameter. Fields consumed:
- `state.feature`, `state.status`, `state.createdAt`, `state.completedAt`, `state._last_modified` — header
- `state.tasks[]` — task summary, what shipped, blocked/failed, recommendations
- `state.gates[]` — gate verdicts, cost breakdown
- `state.transitionCount` — cost breakdown
- `state.tokenUsage` — cost breakdown

All fields are part of the established STATE.json contract. No new fields are introduced. The function uses defensive access throughout (optional chaining `?.`, nullish coalescing `??`, logical OR `||`). This means `buildReport` degrades gracefully against incomplete state — it never throws on missing data.

### 3. Separation of Concerns — PASS

Clean split between logic and I/O:
- `buildReport(state) → string` — pure transformation, zero side effects, fully unit-testable
- `cmdReport(args, deps)` — I/O shell: reads args, resolves paths, reads state, delegates to `buildReport`, writes output

`cmdReport` uses dependency injection for all 7 external dependencies (`readState`, `existsSync`, `writeFileSync`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `exit`, `cwd`). This is the project's established testability pattern, visible in `cmdStatus`, `cmdMetrics`, and `cmdAudit`. Consistency is good.

### 4. Scalability of Design

`buildReport` is a linear string builder: iterate tasks once for each section, join lines. For a report generator, this is the right complexity level. The function is 117 lines — readable in a single screen, no abstractions needed.

The gate-filtering pattern (`gates.filter(g => g.taskId === task.id)`) is O(n×m), but both n (tasks per feature) and m (gates per feature) are bounded by design to <100. No index needed.

If the report format needs to change (e.g., JSON output, HTML), the current architecture supports it: swap `buildReport` for `buildReportJson` or add a format parameter. No structural changes needed. But no premature abstraction was added — correct decision for a v1.

### 5. CLI Integration Pattern — PASS

The dispatch in `agt.mjs:75` is synchronous (`cmdReport(args)`), matching the pattern for non-async commands (`cmdInit`, `cmdDoctor`, `cmdStatus`). The help block at lines 188–195 follows the exact same structure as all other help entries: `usage`, `description`, `flags`, `examples`. The summary line at line 248 matches the format of other summary entries. No special-casing, no pattern breaks.

### 6. Dependency Risk — PASS

No new npm dependencies introduced. `report.mjs` uses only Node.js stdlib (`fs`, `path`) and the existing `readState` utility. Zero supply chain risk.

---

## Edge Cases Verified (Architect Lens)

| Concern | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Does `buildReport` couple to `cmdReport`? | Read both functions | No — `buildReport` is pure, takes `state`, returns string. `cmdReport` calls it but no reverse dependency |
| Does `report.mjs` import any run-loop or harness code? | Read imports at lines 1–6 | No — only `fs`, `path`, `util.readState` |
| Does `cmdReport` follow the project's DI pattern? | Compare with `cmdStatus` in `status.mjs` | Yes — same deps object shape, same default-to-real pattern |
| Does the help block follow existing conventions? | Compare with `run`, `audit`, `doctor` help blocks in `agt.mjs` | Yes — identical structure |
| Is the module imported from anywhere besides `agt.mjs`? | `grep -r "report.mjs" bin/` | Only `agt.mjs:19` — single consumer |
| Could `buildReport` grow to require async I/O? | Assess current state reads | No — `buildReport` receives pre-loaded state. If future needs require async, only `cmdReport` changes |

---

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:148 — `featureName` from CLI args is passed unsanitized to `path.join()`. With `--md`, this writes REPORT.md to an attacker-controlled path (e.g., `agt report ../../../../tmp --md`). Low risk for direct CLI use but real risk if `cmdReport` is ever called programmatically with external input. Validate `featureName` against `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/` before constructing `featureDir`. This was also flagged in the prior engineer review — concur it should enter the backlog.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:55 — Gate lookup `gates.filter(g => g.taskId === task.id)` is repeated per task. At current scale this is fine, but if task counts grow, pre-indexing gates into a `Map<taskId, gate[]>` would be a clean optimization. Not needed now.

🔵 bin/agt.mjs:226–254 — The general help text at the bottom of the `default` case duplicates the help text inside `case "help"`. If a new command is added, both must be updated. Consider extracting command summaries into a shared data structure. This predates `report` and is not caused by this feature — noting for future consolidation.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The execution-report feature is architecturally sound. `report.mjs` is a well-bounded, single-purpose module that follows every established project pattern: separate file in `bin/lib/`, pure logic function + DI-enabled CLI handler, consistent help block, no new dependencies. The module introduces zero coupling to the run loop, harness, or state machine — it only reads the STATE.json contract that already exists. `buildReport` as a pure function is the strongest possible design choice for testability and future extensibility. All 29 tests pass independently. One 🟡 warning (path traversal) concurs with the prior engineer review and should enter the backlog. Two 🔵 suggestions are optional — gate pre-indexing and help deduplication are not justified at current scale. No critical issues block merge.

## Builder Claims vs Evidence

**Claim (handshake.json task-1):** "Verified `agt report <feature>` prints all 6 required sections (Header, What Shipped, Task Summary, Cost Breakdown, Blocked/Failed, Recommendations) to stdout. Implementation in bin/lib/report.mjs with CLI wiring in bin/agt.mjs. Full test suite passes: 547 pass, 0 fail, 2 skipped."

**Verified:**
1. All 6 sections are implemented in `buildReport` (lines 15–114) ✓
2. CLI wiring: import at `agt.mjs:19`, dispatch at `agt.mjs:75`, help at `agt.mjs:188-194` ✓
3. Tests pass: confirmed independently — 29/29 pass ✓
4. Artifacts listed (report.mjs, agt.mjs, report.test.mjs) all exist ✓

---

## Per-Criterion Results

### 1. Test Strategy — are the right things tested at the right level?

**PASS**

The test architecture is sound:
- **Unit tests** on `buildReport` (pure function, state in → string out): 21 tests covering all 6 report sections, status labels, conditional sections, recommendations logic
- **Integration tests** on `cmdReport` with full dependency injection: 8 tests covering error paths (missing name, missing dir, missing state), stdout output, `--md` file write, and CLI help
- **One true integration test** via `spawnSync` at line 366 verifying `agt help report` works end-to-end

This split is correct: fast unit tests for logic, DI-based integration for wiring, one spawned-process test for CLI correctness.

### 2. Coverage gaps — what paths or inputs aren't covered?

**PASS with gaps flagged**

I manually exercised the following untested paths and verified their behavior:

| Untested path | Manual result | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Duration `Xh Ym` format (>60 min) | Correctly renders `"1h 30m"` | Low — arithmetic is simple |
| Duration exactly 60 min | Correctly renders `"1h"` | Low |
| Duration `N/A` (no `createdAt`) | Correctly renders `"N/A"` | Low |
| Invalid `createdAt` ISO | Renders `"NaNh"` — garbage output | Low — harness always writes valid ISO |
| Empty tasks array (`tasks: []`) | Works — empty table rendered | Low |
| Mixed blocked + failed in same state | Both `[BLOCKED]` and `[FAILED]` render correctly | Low |
| Empty string `lastReason` (`""`) | Correctly suppressed (falsy guard) | Low |
| `failGates > 0 && passGates === 0` | Fires `"No gate passes recorded"` recommendation | Low |
| `--md` flag before positional arg | Works — `args.find(a => !a.startsWith("-"))` skips flags | Low |
| Empty `gateWarningHistory[].layers` | Renders `"Task t1 has repeated gate warnings: "` with trailing blank | Low — cosmetic |

**None of these are tested.** The gaps are all in low-risk paths with simple logic, but collectively they represent weak coverage of the duration calculation branch and recommendation triggers.

### 3. Edge cases — boundary values, error states

**PASS**

Tested boundaries I verified:
- **Attempts threshold**: Tests at lines 130 and 141 verify `>=3` fires and `2` does not. Boundary is correctly at 3. ✓
- **Conditional section guards**: Blocked/Failed section absent when no problem tasks (line 124). What Shipped absent when no passed tasks (line 82). Both negative assertions confirmed. ✓
- **`lastReason` presence/absence**: Four tests cover blocked±lastReason and failed±lastReason (lines 109, 163, 173, 196). ✓
- **Status label ternary**: All four branches tested: completed (210), failed (189), blocked (228), fallback "run in progress" (183). ✓

### 4. Regression risks — could this change break existing functionality?

**PASS**

Key regression guards:
| If someone... | Test that catches it |
|---|---|
| Removes `if (task.lastReason)` guard (line 85) | Lines 163, 173 fail |
| Removes `if (problem.length > 0)` guard (line 81) | Line 124 fails |
| Changes status label ternary (lines 30–33) | Lines 183, 189, 228 fail |
| Breaks task summary table format | Lines 53–61 fail |
| Removes `--md` branch | Lines 326, 338 fail |
| Breaks error routing (stdout vs stderr) | stderr assertions at lines 289, 298, 307 fail |
| Removes CLI wiring in agt.mjs | Line 366 (spawnSync) fails |

One gap: no regression guard on the duration calculation. If someone changes the `< 60` threshold or the `hours`/`rem` arithmetic, no test would catch it.

---

## Edge Cases Verified via Direct Invocation

| Edge case | Tested by suite? | Manual result |
|---|---|---|
| Blocked task with lastReason | Yes (line 109) | ✓ |
| Failed task with lastReason | Yes (line 196) | ✓ |
| All tasks passed → no Blocked section | Yes (line 124) | ✓ |
| Blocked without lastReason | Yes (line 163) | ✓ |
| Failed without lastReason | Yes (line 173) | ✓ |
| Empty string lastReason | **No** | ✓ Suppressed (falsy) |
| Mixed blocked + failed | **No** | ✓ Both labels render |
| Empty tasks array | **No** | ✓ Empty table |
| Duration > 60 min | **No** | ✓ `"1h 30m"` |
| Duration = 60 min | **No** | ✓ `"1h"` |
| Invalid createdAt | **No** | ✗ `"NaNh"` |
| Empty gateWarningHistory layers | **No** | ✗ Trailing blank in message |
| `--md` before positional | **No** | ✓ Works correctly |
| No gate passes recommendation | **No** | ✓ Fires correctly |

---

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:16-28 — Duration rendering has zero test coverage. No test asserts the actual duration value for any format (minutes, hours, hours+minutes, N/A). The `if (mins < 60)` and `else` branches, including the `rem > 0` sub-branch, are exercised but never verified. Add at least one test per format: `"45m"`, `"1h"`, `"1h 30m"`, and `"N/A"`.

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:107-108 — The `failGates > 0 && passGates === 0` recommendation ("No gate passes recorded") has no test coverage. This logic path is reachable and produces correct output (verified manually), but a refactor could silently break it. Add a test with `gates: [{ verdict: "FAIL" }]` and no PASS gates.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:17-21 — Invalid ISO `createdAt` (e.g., `"not-a-date"`) produces `"NaNh"` duration via NaN arithmetic. Guard with `Number.isFinite(mins)` and fall back to `"N/A"`. Low risk: the harness always writes valid ISO timestamps.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:98-100 — Empty `gateWarningHistory[].layers` array produces `"Task X has repeated gate warnings: "` with a trailing blank after the colon. Guard on `unique.length > 0` before pushing. Low risk: cosmetic issue.

🔵 test/report.test.mjs:109 — No test exercises mixed blocked + failed tasks in the same report. All tests have either one blocked or one failed task, never both. Add a state with both statuses to verify the loop renders both `[BLOCKED]` and `[FAILED]` labels. Low risk: the loop is trivial.

🔵 test/report.test.mjs:163 — No test for empty-string `lastReason` (`lastReason: ""`). The `if (task.lastReason)` guard treats `""` as falsy (correct), but if refactored to `!== undefined`, empty reasons would leak as `"Reason: "`. A pinning test would prevent this regression.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The test suite is well-structured with the right unit/integration split. The 29 tests cover all 6 report sections, all error paths, both output modes (stdout and `--md`), all status labels, and the conditional section guards. Regression coverage is strong for the Blocked/Failed section after the task-7 improvements.

Two 🟡 warnings flag genuine coverage gaps: duration rendering and the "no gate passes" recommendation are fully untested code paths that produce correct output today but have no regression guard. These should enter the backlog. Four 🔵 suggestions identify optional hardening (NaN guard, cosmetic fix) and additional edge-case tests. No critical issues block merge.

## Spec vs Implementation

**Spec (PRODUCT.md #26):**
> Execution report — Post-run structured report: what shipped, what passed/failed, time spent, token usage, recommendations. `agt report <feature>` prints to stdout; `--md` writes REPORT.md.

### Requirement Traceability

| Spec Requirement | Implemented? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "what shipped" | ✅ | Section 2 "What Shipped" — lists titles of passed tasks (report.mjs:40–48) |
| "what passed/failed" | ✅ | Section 3 "Task Summary" — table with status column (report.mjs:50–59); Section 5 "Blocked/Failed Tasks" — conditional detail (report.mjs:79–88) |
| "time spent" | ✅ | Header shows duration computed from `createdAt`→`completedAt` (report.mjs:16–28) |
| "token usage" | ✅ | Section 4 "Cost Breakdown" — total USD, dispatch count, gate counts, per-phase split (report.mjs:61–77) |
| "recommendations" | ✅ | Section 6 "Recommendations" — high-attempt tasks, gate warnings, stalled detection (report.mjs:90–114) |
| "`agt report <feature>` prints to stdout" | ✅ | cmdReport default path writes to stdout (report.mjs:170); tested at test/report.test.mjs:312–322 |
| "`--md` writes REPORT.md" | ✅ | cmdReport writes to feature dir (report.mjs:165–168); tested at test/report.test.mjs:326–334 |

**All 7 spec requirements are implemented and tested.** No requirements were missed.

### Scope Assessment

The implementation includes exactly what was specified and nothing more:
- No over-engineered config system
- No extra CLI flags beyond `--md`
- No unnecessary abstractions
- The 6 report sections map directly to the spec's listed items

The Recommendations section (high-attempt tasks, gate warnings, stalled detection) is a reasonable interpretation of "recommendations" from the spec. It provides actionable guidance derived from data already present in STATE.json rather than inventing new data sources.

---

## User Value Assessment

### Does this meaningfully improve the user's experience?

**Yes.** Before this feature, users had no structured way to understand what happened during a feature's execution. They had to manually inspect STATE.json (a large JSON file with internal schema) to understand outcomes, costs, and problem areas.

`agt report <feature>` provides:
1. **At-a-glance status** — header with status, duration, task count
2. **What shipped** — immediately answers "what did I get?"
3. **Task-by-task breakdown** — table with attempts and gate verdicts for debugging
4. **Cost transparency** — USD costs, dispatch counts, gate pass/fail ratios
5. **Actionable recommendations** — highlights tasks that struggled, warns about stalled features

The `--md` flag enables archival and sharing — reasonable for teams that want to keep records.

### Acceptance Criteria — Can I verify "done"?

Yes. The spec has clear, testable acceptance criteria:
1. Run `agt report <feature>` → get structured output to stdout ✓
2. Run `agt report <feature> --md` → get REPORT.md written to feature dir ✓
3. Output includes: what shipped, pass/fail, time, token usage, recommendations ✓

Each criterion is verified by at least one test case.

---

## Error UX Review

The three error paths produce clear, actionable messages:
- `Usage: agt report <feature>` — tells the user what to do
- `report: feature directory not found: <path>` — tells the user what went wrong and where it looked
- `report: STATE.json missing or unreadable in <path>` — explains the root cause

All errors go to stderr (not stdout), so piping/redirection works correctly.

---

## Help Text Review

`agt help report` (verified via test at report.test.mjs:366–375) shows:
- Usage: `agt report <feature> [--md]`
- Description of what it does
- `--md` flag documentation
- Example: `agt report my-feature`

The main `agt help` output includes `report <feature>` in the command list (agt.mjs:248, 868).

---

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:148 — Path traversal via unsanitized feature name (concurs with Engineer and Architect reviews). Add to backlog: validate `featureName` matches a safe pattern before constructing file paths.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:68 — When `tokenUsage` is not present, cost shows `N/A (see \`agt metrics\`)` — the `agt metrics` command doesn't exist yet. The reference is forward-looking but could confuse users. Consider showing just `N/A` until the metrics command ships.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The implementation delivers exactly what the spec defined — no more, no less. All 7 traceable requirements from PRODUCT.md #26 are implemented and covered by tests. The feature provides clear user value by transforming raw STATE.json data into a readable, structured report. Error messages are clear and actionable. Help text is complete. The `--md` flag correctly supports both interactive use (stdout) and archival use (file output). Scope is tight — no feature creep, no unnecessary abstractions.

One 🟡 path-traversal warning should enter the backlog. One 🔵 suggestion about the non-existent `agt metrics` reference is cosmetic. No critical issues.

## Builder Claims vs Evidence

**Task-1 handshake claims:** Verified `agt report <feature>` prints all 6 required sections to stdout. Implementation in `bin/lib/report.mjs` with CLI wiring in `bin/agt.mjs`. Full test suite passes.

**Artifacts claimed:**
| Artifact | Exists? | Verified? |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/lib/report.mjs` | Yes (173 lines) | Read in full |
| `bin/agt.mjs` | Yes (import + dispatch) | Read relevant lines |
| `test/report.test.mjs` | Yes (377 lines) | Read in full, ran independently |

**Task-7 handshake claims:** Fixed dead code (`|| "unknown"` fallback), added regression tests, fixed section comment numbering, improved test assertion specificity.

All task-7 claims verified against `git diff a96f37e..c4ccb69` in the prior architect review. I confirmed the dead code removal at line 84 of report.mjs — the `|| "unknown"` fallback is gone and the filter at line 80 guarantees `task.status ∈ {"blocked", "failed"}`.

---

## Veto Category Assessment

### 1. Dead Code — PASS

No dead code found:

- **`isComplete` variable removed** — The diff shows `const isComplete = status === "completed"` was deleted and replaced with the inline status-label ternary. Good — the variable was only used once and the ternary is clearer.
- **`|| "unknown"` fallback removed** — Task-7 fix. The filter at line 80 guarantees `task.status` is `"blocked"` or `"failed"`, making the fallback unreachable. Correctly removed.
- **All imports used** — `existsSync`, `writeFileSync` (line 4), `join` (line 5), `readState` (line 6). Each used exactly once in `cmdReport`.
- **All variables used** — Every declared variable in `buildReport` and `cmdReport` is referenced downstream. Checked: `lines`, `feature`, `status`, `tasks`, `gates`, `duration`, `statusLabel`, `passedTasks`, `passGates`, `failGates`, `totalCostUsd`, `totalCost`, `byPhase`, `perPhase`, `problem`, `recs`, `highAttempts`, `gateWarnings`, `outputMd`, `featureName`, `featureDir`, `state`, `report`.
- **No commented-out code.**
- **No unreachable branches** — All `if` conditions can be true or false depending on input state.

### 2. Premature Abstraction — PASS

- **`buildReport` export:** Used at 2 call sites — internally by `cmdReport` (line 163) and by the test file (21 test calls). The separation is not abstraction for abstraction's sake; it separates pure formatting from I/O dispatch, enabling direct unit testing. Justified.
- **No interfaces with single implementations.**
- **No class hierarchies, factories, or registries.**
- **Test helpers** (`makeState`, `makeDeps`, `createTmpDir`): Each used at 7+ call sites. Well above the threshold.

### 3. Unnecessary Indirection — PASS

- **DI pattern in `cmdReport`** — 7 injected dependencies (readState, existsSync, writeFileSync, stdout, stderr, exit, cwd). Each is exercised by the 8 integration tests. This is the project's standard testability pattern (confirmed in prior reviews). The alternative — stubbing globals or using a filesystem test harness — would be more complex, not less.
- **No wrapper-only-delegates pattern** — `cmdReport` does real work: argument parsing, validation, error routing, file writing. It's not a pass-through.
- **No re-exports without added value.**

### 4. Gold-Plating — PASS

- **`--md` flag:** Spec-required (`PRODUCT.md #26`). Tested. Appears in help text. Not speculative.
- **Status label 4-way ternary** (completed/failed/blocked/run in progress): All four states are reachable and tested. Features can be in any of these states when a report is generated.
- **`tokenUsage.byPhase` rendering** (lines 69–72): Reads existing STATE.json data. The map/join is 2 lines. No config option — it renders whatever phases exist. Not gold-plating.
- **4 recommendation heuristics** (high-attempts, gate-warnings, stalled, no-passes): Each is tested individually. Each produces actionable user-facing guidance. The total is 25 lines of code. The heuristics are simple conditionals, not a pluggable recommendation engine.
- **Duration formatting** (lines 16–29): Handles minutes and hours. 13 lines. Simpler than importing a date library.
- **No feature flags, no config options, no plugin system, no extensibility hooks.**

---

## Cognitive Load Assessment

**Low.** `buildReport` is a linear function: 6 sections, each independent, each labeled with a comment. You read it top to bottom. No callbacks, no state machines, no async, no inheritance. `cmdReport` is a 44-line validate-read-format-output pipeline. The total production diff is 46 lines changed — appropriate for the scope.

---

## Findings

No findings.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The implementation is clean and minimal. `buildReport` is a 117-line pure function with no indirection, no abstractions beyond what the 6-section report structure requires, and no dead code. `cmdReport` is a straightforward CLI dispatch wrapper using the project's standard DI pattern. The `--output md` → `--md` simplification in this branch removed complexity. The `isComplete` dead variable and `|| "unknown"` dead fallback were both correctly deleted. All 29 tests pass. No violations across any of the four veto categories (dead code, premature abstraction, unnecessary indirection, gold-plating). No warnings. No critical findings.

## Threat Model

**What is this?** A local CLI command (`agt report <feature>`) that reads `STATE.json` from disk, formats it as text/markdown, and either prints to stdout or writes `REPORT.md`.

**Who are the adversaries?**
- Direct CLI use: the operator is the user — no adversary. The user already has full filesystem access.
- Orchestrated use: if an outer loop, CI pipeline, or automation layer feeds untrusted input as the `<feature>` argument, path traversal becomes possible.

**Attack surface:** CLI argument parsing (lines 129–130), filesystem read via `readState` (line 156), filesystem write via `writeFileSync` (line 167).

**Data sensitivity:** `STATE.json` contains task metadata, cost figures (`tokenUsage.costUsd`), and execution timing. No credentials, tokens, PII, or secrets.

---

## Per-Criterion Results

### 1. Input Validation — featureName from CLI args

**PASS with warning caveat**

`featureName` is extracted at line 130 via `args.find(a => !a.startsWith("-"))`. This value is passed unsanitized to `path.join(_cwd(), ".team", "features", featureName)` at line 148. `path.join` resolves `..` components, so `agt report ../../etc --md` resolves to `<cwd>/etc/REPORT.md`.

**Risk assessment:** For direct CLI use, the operator already controls the filesystem — this is a non-issue. The concern arises if `featureName` is sourced from untrusted input (e.g., a webhook body, GitHub issue title, or automated dispatcher). The prior engineer and architect reviews both flagged this — concur.

**Mitigation (backlog):** Add `if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/.test(featureName)) { _stderr.write("report: invalid feature name\n"); _exit(1); return; }` before line 148.

### 2. No Command Injection

**PASS**

The code does not use `exec`, `spawn`, `eval`, `Function()`, or any shell-executing API. `buildReport` is a pure function. `cmdReport` uses `readState` (synchronous file read + JSON.parse), `existsSync`, and `writeFileSync` — all filesystem-only operations. No user input is interpolated into commands.

Verified: searched `report.mjs` for `exec`, `spawn`, `eval`, `child_process`, `import("child_process")` — none present.

### 3. JSON Parsing Safety

**PASS**

`readState` in `util.mjs:190–197` wraps `JSON.parse` in a try/catch and returns `null` on failure. `cmdReport` checks for null at line 157 and exits cleanly. No prototype pollution risk — the parsed object is consumed read-only by `buildReport`, which only reads properties (never assigns to `__proto__`, `constructor`, or similar).

`buildReport` uses defensive defaults throughout:
- `state.feature || "unknown"` (line 10)
- `state.tasks || []` (line 12)
- `state.tokenUsage?.total?.costUsd` with null check (lines 65–68)
- `task.attempts ?? 0` (line 57)
- `task.title || "—"` (line 57)

No path leads to `undefined.method()` crashes from malformed STATE.json.

### 4. File Write Safety (--md mode)

**PASS with caveat (same as #1)**

`writeFileSync` at line 167 writes to `join(featureDir, "REPORT.md")`. The output content is the return value of `buildReport(state)` — a plain string derived from STATE.json data. No user-controlled bytes are injected outside of what is already in STATE.json.

The write is synchronous and atomic at the OS level (no TOCTOU window). The file is overwritten without confirmation, which is standard CLI behavior.

The path traversal concern from criterion #1 applies here: with `--md`, a traversed `featureDir` means writing `REPORT.md` to an arbitrary directory. Without `--md`, the code only reads and prints — no write risk.

### 5. Output Injection / XSS

**PASS**

`buildReport` produces plain-text markdown. If the markdown is later rendered as HTML by a viewer that does not sanitize, crafted task titles or `lastReason` values could inject HTML/script. However:
- STATE.json is written exclusively by the harness (`_written_by: "at-harness"` at `util.mjs:202`)
- Task titles and reasons are generated by the agent framework, not by external users
- The report is consumed by CLI stdout or written to a local `.md` file

This is not a realistic XSS vector given the trust boundary (harness to report to local file/terminal).

### 6. Error Message Information Disclosure

**PASS (suggestion)**

Error messages at lines 151 and 158 include the full resolved filesystem path. For a local CLI, this is expected and helpful. If stderr is ever relayed to a dashboard, webhook, or log aggregation service, it could leak the directory structure. Low risk.

### 7. Secrets Management — N/A

**PASS**

No credentials, API keys, tokens, or secrets are read, written, logged, or transmitted. The `tokenUsage.costUsd` field is a dollar amount, not a secret. The `_write_nonce` in STATE.json is a data integrity marker, not a cryptographic secret.

### 8. Dependency Injection — No Privilege Escalation

**PASS**

`cmdReport` accepts a `deps` object for testability (lines 132–140). All 7 injected functions have safe defaults (real `fs` and `process` APIs). The DI surface is internal — callers are `bin/agt.mjs` (line 75, no deps override) and `test/report.test.mjs` (test-only mocks). No external caller can inject malicious implementations.

---

## Edge Cases Checked (Security Lens)

| Edge case | Security implication | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `featureName = "../../etc"` | Path traversal — reads/writes outside project | Not guarded; low risk for CLI, real risk if orchestrated |
| `featureName = ""` (empty string) | `path.join` produces `<cwd>/.team/features/` | Caught: `args.find` returns `undefined` for missing arg then exit 1 |
| `featureName = "--md"` | Interpreted as flag, not feature name | Correctly handled: `args.find(a => !a.startsWith("-"))` skips it then exit 1 |
| `STATE.json` with `__proto__` key | Prototype pollution via JSON.parse | Not exploitable: parsed object used read-only |
| `costUsd` as non-number | `.toFixed()` throws | Guarded by `!= null` check but not `typeof`; low risk — harness writes numeric values |
| `title` containing pipe char | Breaks markdown table | Formatting issue only; no security impact |
| `lastReason` with embedded newline | Report formatting breaks | Not security-relevant; harness-generated reasons are single-line |

---

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:148 — `featureName` from CLI args passed unsanitized to `path.join()`; with `--md`, writes `REPORT.md` to an attacker-controlled path (e.g., `agt report ../../../../tmp --md`). Validate `featureName` matches `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/` before constructing `featureDir`. Low risk for direct CLI use; real risk if orchestrated with external input. Concurs with prior engineer and architect reviews.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:151 — Error messages interpolate full resolved filesystem path to stderr. Safe for CLI; could leak directory structure if stderr is relayed externally.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:57 — Task titles from STATE.json interpolated into markdown table rows without escaping pipe characters. Formatting concern only; no security impact unless output is rendered as HTML without sanitization.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The implementation has a small attack surface: one CLI argument parsed from `process.argv`, one filesystem read (`STATE.json` via `readState`), and one conditional filesystem write (`REPORT.md` via `writeFileSync`). There is no command injection, no shell execution, no network I/O, no secrets handling, and no prototype pollution risk. `buildReport` is a pure function with no side effects.

The single warning finding — unsanitized `featureName` enabling path traversal — is a legitimate concern for orchestrated/automated use cases but does not represent a risk for direct CLI invocation where the user already controls the entire filesystem. This finding was independently flagged by the prior engineer and architect reviews — all reviewers concur it should enter the backlog. Two suggestions are optional improvements. No critical issues block merge.

## Builder Claims vs Evidence

### task-1 handshake claims:

- Artifacts: `bin/lib/report.mjs`, `bin/agt.mjs`, `test/report.test.mjs`

### task-7 handshake claims:
- "Fixed dead code in Blocked/Failed section: removed unreachable `|| \"unknown\"` fallback"
- "Added regression tests for blocked and failed tasks without lastReason"
- "Fixed section comment numbering and improved test assertion specificity"

**All artifacts exist and all claims are verified.**

---

## Per-Criterion Results

### 1. Correctness — does the code do what the spec says?

**PASS**

Six sections verified in `buildReport` by reading each code path:

| Section | Lines | Verified behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Header | 15–38 | Feature name, status label (4-way ternary at 30–33), duration calc, task count, timestamps |
| What Shipped | 40–48 | Lists passed task titles; section absent when none pass (tested line 82–90) |
| Task Summary | 50–59 | 5-column markdown table; dash fallback for missing title (line 57) and missing gates (line 56) |
| Cost Breakdown | 61–77 | Dollar amount when `costUsd` present (tested line 235–245); N/A fallback; per-phase split from `byPhase` |
| Blocked/Failed | 79–88 | Filter on blocked/failed status (line 80); uppercase label (line 84); conditional `lastReason` (line 85) |
| Recommendations | 90–114 | High-attempt threshold at >=3 (boundary tested at 2, line 141–149); gate warnings with dedup; stalled detection |

CLI wiring in `bin/agt.mjs`: import at line 19, dispatch at line 75, help text at lines 188–194, summary at line 248. `cmdReport` defaults to stdout (line 170), `--md` writes `REPORT.md` (lines 165–168). `args.find(a => !a.startsWith("-"))` at line 130 correctly extracts positional feature name even when `--md` precedes it.

### 2. Code quality — readable, well-named, easy to reason about?

**PASS**

`buildReport` is a pure function: state in, string out. No I/O, no side effects. `cmdReport` uses DI for all 7 external dependencies, matching the project's established testability pattern. Variable names are descriptive. Section comments are numbered 1–6, matching the logical structure. No dead code remains.

### 3. Error handling — failure paths handled explicitly and safely?

**PASS**

Three error paths in `cmdReport`, all tested and all routing to stderr with exit code 1:
- Missing feature name (lines 142–146, test line 285)
- Feature dir absent (lines 150–154, test line 294)
- STATE.json missing/corrupt (lines 157–161, test line 303)

`readState` catches JSON parse errors and returns `null`. `buildReport` never throws: optional chaining and nullish coalescing guard all nullable paths. Each `_exit(1)` is followed by `return` — defensive against mocked `_exit`.

### 4. Performance — obvious inefficiencies?

**PASS**

Single synchronous JSON parse. Gate filtering at line 55 is O(T*G) per task — negligible at typical feature sizes. No repeated I/O, no unnecessary allocations.

### 5. Edge cases verified

| Edge case | How I verified | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `--md` before positional arg | Read line 130 | Correct — `find()` skips flags |
| No feature name | Read lines 142–146 + test | exits 1 + usage |
| Feature dir missing | Read lines 150–154 + test | exits 1 + message |
| STATE.json missing | Read lines 157–161 + test | exits 1 + message |
| STATE.json corrupt | Read `readState` catch block | returns null, caught |
| Task with no gates | Read line 56 + test line 92 | dash shown |
| Missing title (table vs blocked) | Read lines 57 and 84 | Different fallbacks, intentional |
| Blocked/failed with/without lastReason | Read line 85 + tests 109, 163, 173, 196 | All paths correct |
| Stalled rec | Read line 102 + test line 216 | fires correctly |
| Attempt threshold boundary | Read line 92 + tests 130, 141 | >=3 fires, 2 does not |
| `tokenUsage.byPhase` | Read lines 69–72 + test line 235 | Correct formatting |
| Invalid ISO `createdAt` | Read lines 17–28 | NaN arithmetic, not guarded |
| Negative duration | Read line 22 | Negative minutes rendered, cosmetic |
| Empty `gateWarningHistory.layers` | Read lines 98–100 | Trailing blank, cosmetic |

---

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:148 — `featureName` from CLI args is passed unsanitized to `path.join()`. With `--md`, this writes `REPORT.md` to an attacker-controlled path. The `existsSync` check limits exploitability to existing directories, but in an agentic system where tool inputs may come from LLM output, this is a real concern. Validate `featureName` against a safe pattern before constructing `featureDir`.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:21 — Invalid ISO string in `createdAt` produces NaN duration string. Add `Number.isFinite(mins)` guard and fall back to `"N/A"`.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:100 — Empty `gateWarningHistory[].layers` produces trailing blank in recommendation text. Guard on `unique.length > 0` before pushing.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:107 — `"No gate passes recorded"` fires for in-progress features on first gate failure (false positive). Guard on terminal status before emitting.

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The implementation correctly satisfies the spec. `buildReport` is a clean pure function producing all 6 required sections. `cmdReport` uses idiomatic DI with proper error routing to stderr. All 29 tests pass independently. The task-7 fix cleanly removed unreachable dead code and added proper regression tests. One 🟡 warning (path traversal via unsanitized feature name) should enter the backlog. Three 🔵 suggestions are optional quality improvements for edge-case cosmetics. No critical issues block merge.

---

## Threat Model

This is a local CLI tool (`agt report`) run by a developer in their own terminal. Attack surface:

| Surface | Entry point | Threat |
|---|---|---|
| CLI arguments | `featureName`, `--output md` | Path traversal, unexpected file writes |
| STATE.json content | `readState()` → `JSON.parse()` | Injection via rendered fields (titles, lastReason) |
| File output | `writeFileSync(REPORT.md)` | Write to unintended location |

**Primary adversary**: Automated pipeline or script that invokes `agt report` with externally-sourced feature names (CI, orchestrators, programmatic callers).

**Secondary adversary**: Compromised upstream tool that writes malicious content to STATE.json (e.g., ANSI escape codes in `lastReason`).

**Out of scope**: Direct interactive user (they control their own terminal — "user attacks themselves" is not a meaningful threat).

---

## Per-Criterion Results

### 1. Input Validation — is all user input sanitized?

**PASS (with 🟡 caveat)**

`featureName` from CLI args flows unsanitized into `path.join()` at line 149:

```js
const featureDir = join(_cwd(), ".team", "features", featureName);
```

`path.join("/project", ".team", "features", "../../..")` normalizes to `/project`. With `--output md`, `writeFileSync(join(featureDir, "REPORT.md"), ...)` would write to `/project/REPORT.md` — outside the `.team/features/` subtree.

However, the exploit requires:
1. A caller passing attacker-controlled input as the feature name
2. The `--output md` flag to trigger the write path
3. The target directory must exist (checked by `existsSync` at line 151)

For direct interactive CLI use, exploitability is negligible. For programmatic invocation (CI scripts reading feature names from config or environment), the risk is medium. The prior engineer review correctly identified this as 🟡.

Other inputs are validated:
- Missing feature name → exit 1 with usage (line 143) ✓
- `--output` with unknown value → silent fallback to stdout (safe default) ✓
- `--output` as last arg → `args[outputIdx + 1]` is `undefined`, `outputMd` is false (safe) ✓

### 2. Secrets Management — are credentials handled safely?

**PASS**

No credentials, tokens, API keys, or secrets are read, stored, or transmitted. The tool reads STATE.json (project metadata) and writes plaintext markdown. No environment variables are accessed for auth purposes. No network calls are made.

### 3. Authentication & Authorization — are access controls correct?

**N/A**

This is a local CLI tool with no auth model. File access uses the invoking user's OS permissions. No privilege escalation vectors exist.

### 4. Output Safety — is output safe from injection?

**PASS**

`buildReport` interpolates STATE.json fields directly into template strings:
- `${feature}` (line 34)
- `${task.title || task.id}` (line 45)
- `${task.lastReason}` (line 85)
- `${task.id}` (lines 57, 84, 94, 100)

Output destinations:
- **Stdout** (terminal): ANSI escape sequences in STATE.json fields would render in the terminal. This is a theoretical terminal UI spoofing vector, but requires the attacker to already have write access to STATE.json — at which point they have far more powerful attack paths. 🔵 level.
- **REPORT.md** (file): Markdown with user-controlled content. No HTML rendering context, no script execution. Safe.

No SQL, no shell execution, no HTML rendering. The output is consumed by humans reading text — no injection vector with meaningful impact.

### 5. Error Handling — do errors leak sensitive information?

**PASS**

Error messages include the constructed `featureDir` path:
```
report: feature directory not found: /Users/dev/project/.team/features/bad-name
```

For a local CLI tool, this is expected and helpful. The path is derived from `cwd()` + user input — no server-side secrets, no database connection strings, no internal infrastructure details are leaked.

### 6. File Write Safety — is `writeFileSync` used safely?

**PASS (with 🟡 caveat from criterion 1)**

`writeFileSync` at line 168:
- Writes to a deterministic path (`featureDir/REPORT.md`) — no TOCTOU race
- Uses default permissions (0o666 before umask) — appropriate for a project file
- Content is the report string + newline — no binary data, no user-supplied filename
- The `existsSync(featureDir)` check at line 151 prevents writes to nonexistent directories

The only concern is the path traversal from criterion 1, which could redirect the write target.

### 7. Dependency Surface

**PASS**

Only Node.js built-ins are imported: `fs` (`existsSync`, `writeFileSync`), `path` (`join`). Plus one internal module (`readState` from `util.mjs`). No third-party dependencies. No network calls. No child process spawning in the report command itself.

## Edge Cases Checked

| Edge case | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `featureName` with `../` traversal | Manual code trace of `path.join` | Escapes `.team/features/` — flagged as 🟡 |
| `--output` as last arg (no value) | Code trace: `args[outputIdx + 1]` → `undefined` | Falls back to stdout safely ✓ |
| `--output xyz` (unknown format) | Code trace: `"xyz" === "md"` → false | Falls back to stdout safely ✓ |
| `STATE.json` with corrupt JSON | Code trace: `readState` catches, returns null | `cmdReport` exits 1 ✓ |
| `writeFileSync` to read-only dir | Node throws `EACCES` | Unhandled — process crashes with stack trace. Acceptable for CLI tool. |
| Feature name with shell metacharacters | Code trace: name only used in `path.join` + `existsSync` | No shell execution — safe ✓ |
| `lastReason` with newlines | Code trace: interpolated directly | Breaks markdown formatting but no security impact ✓ |
| Empty `tasks` array | Code trace: all sections use `.filter()` | Renders empty table, no errors ✓ |

## Findings

🟡 bin/lib/report.mjs:149 — `featureName` from CLI args is joined into `featureDir` without sanitization. `path.join(cwd, ".team", "features", "../../..")` escapes the `.team/features/` subtree. With `--output md`, this allows writing `REPORT.md` to an attacker-controlled path. Low risk for interactive CLI use; medium risk if invoked programmatically with external input. Fix: reject names matching `/[\/\\]|\.\./` or validate against `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/`.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:84–85 — STATE.json fields (`lastReason`, `title`) are interpolated into terminal output without stripping ANSI escape codes. A malicious STATE.json could spoof terminal output. Negligible risk since STATE.json write access implies full local compromise.

🔵 bin/lib/report.mjs:130 — `--output` accepts only `md`; unknown values silently fall back to stdout with no warning. Consider emitting a stderr warning for unrecognized output formats to prevent user confusion (not a security issue).

---

## Overall Verdict: PASS

The implementation has a clean security posture appropriate for a local CLI tool. No credentials are handled. No network calls are made. No shell commands are executed with user input. File I/O uses only Node.js built-ins with no third-party dependencies. The single 🟡 finding (path traversal via unsanitized feature name) is a defense-in-depth concern that should enter the backlog — it's low risk for interactive use but becomes relevant if `agt report` is ever called from scripts with external input. Two 🔵 suggestions are optional hardening measures with no realistic threat in the current usage pattern. No critical issues. All 29 tests pass independently.
